st.markdown("***")
st.markdown('In this project, we aim to gain insights into the trends and characterstics of the used car market. By analyzing various factors in pricing, transmission type, cylinder counts, car types, condition, relationship between age and odomter readings. In order to understand the how these influence the customer and the market')
st.markdown('****Key Questions:****')

st.markdown('*Pricing Trends:*')
st.markdown('- What is the distribution of car prices in our inventory?')
st.markdown('- How does the price range vary across different categories and conditions?')

st.markdown('*Transmission Preferences:*')
st.markdown('- What is the proportion of automatic versus manual transmissions in our stock?')
st.markdown('- Are there notable differences in pricing based on transmission type?')

st.markdown('*Cylinder Type:*')
st.markdown('- How are cars distributed among various cylinder counts?')
st.markdown('- Does the cylinder count impact pricing, and if so, how?')

st.markdown('*Car Type Popularity:*')
st.markdown('- Which car types (SUVs, sedans, pickups) are most popular among buyers?')
st.markdown('- Are there pricing variations based on the type of car?')

st.markdown('*Condition Classification:*')
st.markdown("- What percentage of our inventory falls under the 'good' condition category?")
st.markdown('- How does condition classification correlate with pricing?')

st.markdown('*Age and Odometer Relationships:*')

st.markdown("- What is the relationship between a car's age, odometer reading, and pricing?")
            
st.markdown('- How do older cars with higher odometer readings compare in terms of costs?')

st.markdown('*Pricing Trends:*')
st.markdown('- How do car prices evolve as vehicles age, and what role does odometer reading play?')
